![OpenWeather Logo](./img/openweather.png)

This is a command line application that uses the OpenWeather API to print out user queries (city or zipcode) to the CLI. 

## How To Use

* Since this is a command line application, you will need to download the project files first. 
* After you have downloaded the files, open your favorite terminal and navigate to this project's directory.
* In the command line, enter "node app.js   x". Replace "x" with either any world cities name or a zip code.
